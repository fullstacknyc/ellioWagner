            <h1>A BIT ABOUT ME</h1><br>
            <p>Ellio Wagner is a performer born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Ever since she was a little girl,
                she loved to sing and act. Both of her parents are jazz trumpet players (Deborah Wagner and Wayne
                Bergeron), so she grew up singing her favorite jazz songs by legends like Frank Sinatra and Ella
                Fitzgerald. Ellio has been working professionally since the age of 8 years old, being in commercials
                (Burger King, HP, black & decker), TV shows (American Housewife, Drama Club), short films (Monster Under
                the Bed), plays (the Little Match Girl, Noises Off), and musicals (Legally Blonde, the Little Mermaid,
                Urinetown). Along with her passions for singing and acting, she has also been writing songs since the
                age of 10 and has written over 30 original songs. After graduating high school, Ellio started college in
                New York City at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) just two weeks later. She then studied
                at AMDA in their musical theatre/ integrated program and graduated in October 2023. Since graduation,
                Ellio has been up to a lot in New York City. Along with working as a model (Hannah Noelle Models) for
                brands such as Heed NYC and Bumble & Bumble, Ellio performed in "A Sketch of New York" at the Producers
                Club and "The Shelley Show" at Planet Showbiz. Ellio's most recent focus is her music. So far she has
                released her debut singles, I'm Sorry, Marissa and Stupid Guy. She hopes people can connect to her music
                and use it to get through rough times, and she's excited to release more. Stay tuned for new music,
                performances, appearances and announcements! </p>
